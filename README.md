# WabiTabi: Tourism Planning Application (Team 14)
https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~davidgu0/home.php

## Summary
Our project centers around a travel and tourism management application, aiming to serve as a cohesive platform that enriches travel planning for its users. Specifically, our application seeks to empower users with information and tools for crafting, sharing, and exploring travel itineraries, attractions, and user-generated content, including reviews and photos. Our database primarily models crucial elements for efficient travel planning and community engagement, such as Users, Itineraries, Reviews, PhotoReviews, Destinations, Attractions, Photos, Languages, and Dialects.
